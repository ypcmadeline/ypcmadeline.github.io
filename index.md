# About me

One of the challenges of improvising jazz is making choices about pitches while also paying attention to groove, interaction, and narrative form. The Chord-Scale Theory is a method, taught at the Berklee College of Music and many other colleges and universities, that facilitates pitch choices in jazz improvisation. Chord-Scale Theory is based on George Russellâ€™s Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization ([1953] 2001), and it was popularized by jazz educators Jamey Aebersold, David Baker, and Jerry Coker.

## Basic Chord-Scale Relationships

Starting a major scale on each of its seven notes will yield seven different modes. Each of the modes will have a different pattern of half steps and whole steps and thus a different color. (For more information, see Introduction to Diatonic Modes and/or Diatonic Modes).

## Limitations of Chord-Scale Theory

Chord-Scale Theory emphasizes the eye and intellect rather than the ear and intuition. Practicing chord-scale relationships does not substitute for transcribing improvised jazz solos, memorizing tunes, improvising along with recordings, or jamming with other musicians as the preferred methods of learning the oral tradition of jazz improvisation.
